Multi-AZ RDS deployments can have one standby or two standby DB instances. When the deployment has one standby DB instance, it's called a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. A Multi-AZ DB instance deployment has one standby DB instance that provides failover support, but doesn't serve read traffic. When the deployment has two standby DB instances, it's called a Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment. A Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment has standby DB instances that provide failover support and can also serve read traffic.

In a multi-AZ instance deployment, AWS maintains a synchronous database replica in another AZ. However, you can't use this replica for serving read traffic (use a multi-AZ db cluster or a read replica instead). Note that, due to the synchronous nature of the replication, a multi-AZ instance deployment may have higher latency than a single-AZ deployment.

A read-replica is a read-only copy of a DB instance. The source database for a read replica setup becomes the "primary" database, and after the read replica's creation, changes to the primary database get asynchronously written to the read replica.

Encryption on an RDS instance can happen at creation time, but there isn't a way to set encryption on an active database instance without a work-around. The work-around is take a snapshot of the database, copy it as an encrypted snapshot, and restore a database from the encryption snapshot.
