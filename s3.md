Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object to Amazon S3 as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently, and in any order. For uploads, your updated AWS client automatically calculates a checksum of the object and sends it to Amazon S3 along with the size of the object as a part of the request. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles them to create the object. It's a best practice to use multipart upload for objects that are 100 MB or larger instead of uploading them in a single operation.

S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) improves transfer performance by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed Edge Locations and over AWS backbone networks, and by using network protocol optimizations. It can speed up uploads to S3 by 50%-500%.
