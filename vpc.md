VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS databases, Amazon Redshift clusters, and AWS Lambda functions, into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). VPC sharing is not the same as VPC peering.
